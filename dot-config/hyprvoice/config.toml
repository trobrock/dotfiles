# Hyprvoice Configuration
# This file is automatically generated with defaults.
# Edit values as needed - changes are applied immediately without daemon restart.

# Audio Recording Configuration
[recording]
  sample_rate = 16000          # Audio sample rate in Hz (16000 recommended for speech)
  channels = 1                 # Number of audio channels (1 = mono, 2 = stereo)
  format = "s16"               # Audio format (s16 = 16-bit signed integers)
  buffer_size = 8192           # Internal buffer size in bytes (larger = less CPU, more latency)
  device = ""                  # PipeWire audio device (empty = use default microphone)
  channel_buffer_size = 30     # Audio frame buffer size (frames to buffer)
  timeout = "5m0s"               # Maximum recording duration (e.g., "30s", "2m", "5m")

# Speech Transcription Configuration
[transcription]
  provider = "groq-transcription"          # Transcription service: "openai", "groq-transcription", or "groq-translation"
  language = "en"                # Language code (empty for auto-detect, "en", "it", "es", "fr", etc.)
  model = "whisper-large-v3"          # Model: OpenAI="whisper-1", Groq="whisper-large-v3" or "whisper-large-v3-turbo"

# Text Injection Configuration
[injection]
  mode = "fallback"            # Injection method ("clipboard", "type", "fallback")
  restore_clipboard = true     # Restore original clipboard after injection
  wtype_timeout = "5s"         # Timeout for direct typing via wtype
  clipboard_timeout = "3s"     # Timeout for clipboard operations

# Desktop Notification Configuration
[notifications]
  enabled = true               # Enable desktop notifications
  type = "desktop"             # Notification type ("desktop", "log", "none")

# Mode explanations:
# - "clipboard": Copy text to clipboard only
# - "type": Direct typing via wtype only
# - "fallback": Try typing first, fallback to clipboard if it fails
#
# Provider explanations:
# - "openai": OpenAI Whisper API (cloud-based, requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
# - "groq-transcription": Groq Whisper API for transcription (fast, requires GROQ_API_KEY)
#     Models: whisper-large-v3 or whisper-large-v3-turbo
# - "groq-translation": Groq Whisper API for translation to English (always outputs English text)
#     Models: whisper-large-v3 only (turbo not supported for translation)
#
# Language codes: Use empty string ("") for automatic detection, or specific codes like:
# "en" (English), "it" (Italian), "es" (Spanish), "fr" (French), "de" (German), etc.
# For groq-translation, the language field hints at the source audio language for better accuracy.
