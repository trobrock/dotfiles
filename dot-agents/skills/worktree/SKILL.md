# Worktree Management

Manage git worktrees using [Worktrunk](https://worktrunk.dev/) (`wt`) with tmux window integration. Worktrunk handles worktree creation, environment setup (via project hooks), and lifecycle management. This skill adds tmux window orchestration and parallel agent spawning on top.

## Prerequisites

- `wt` (Worktrunk) is installed with shell integration
- `tmux` is running (check with `$TMUX` env var)
- Project hooks in `.config/wt.toml` handle environment setup automatically (dependency installation, port assignment, database provisioning)

## CRITICAL RULES

**Before spawning a worktree, you MUST verify ALL of the following:**

1. **Build mode required.** You must be in build mode (not plan mode) before spawning a worktree. If you are in plan mode, ask the user to switch you to build mode first. Spawning worktrees creates branches and filesystem changes — this is not a read-only operation.

2. **Must be on the root worktree.** Run `wt list --format=json | jq '.[] | select(.is_main == true and .is_current == true)'` to confirm you are on the main/root worktree. If you are inside a child worktree, do NOT spawn new worktrees from there.

3. **ONLY use `wtc --tmux` to spawn agents.** Never manually run `wt switch`, `tmux new-window`, `tmux send-keys`, or any other combination of commands to create worktrees or tmux panes. The `wtc` tool handles ALL of this — branch creation, worktree setup, tmux window creation, and claude session launch. Using anything else will break the workflow.

## Key Concepts

- **Worktree paths** follow the pattern `<repo>.<branch>` as siblings of the main repo directory
- **Ports** are deterministic per branch via `hash_port` (range 10000-19999) -- no collisions, stable across machines
- **`wt list --format=json`** is the authoritative source for worktree paths, URLs, and status
- The agent (you) should **stay in your current working directory** -- operate on remote tmux windows via `tmux send-keys`, never `cd` into a different worktree

## Operations

### 1. Create Worktree + Tmux Window

Create a new worktree and open a dedicated tmux window for it. Worktrunk hooks handle all environment setup (copy-ignored files, mise.local.toml generation, bundle/yarn install, bin/setup).

**Preferred: Use `wtc --tmux`** to create a worktree with a claude session in a detached tmux window without affecting your current shell:

```bash
wtc --tmux "<branch>"
```

This handles branch existence checks, `--create` flag, tmux window creation, and opencode launch automatically. See [Spawn Parallel AI Agent](#4-spawn-parallel-ai-agent-in-a-worktree) for full usage.

**Manual alternative** (ONLY when you need a worktree without claude, e.g., for the user to work in directly — never use this to spawn AI agents):

> **WARNING:** Do NOT use `wt switch` to create worktrees for AI agents. It changes the current shell's working directory and renames the tmux window, contaminating your session. Always use `wtc --tmux` for agent spawning.

```bash
# Check if the branch already exists (local or remote)
branch_exists=$(git branch --list "<branch>" || git ls-remote --heads origin "<branch>")

# Create the worktree (--create only if branch is new)
if [ -z "$branch_exists" ]; then
  wt switch --create "<branch>"
else
  wt switch "<branch>"
fi
```

After the worktree is created, return to your original branch:

```bash
wt switch main  # or whatever branch you were on
```

### 2. Clean Up Worktrees

#### Remove a single worktree

Close the tmux window and remove the worktree + branch:

```bash
# Kill the tmux window (suppressing errors if it doesn't exist)
tmux kill-window -t ":<branch>" 2>/dev/null || true

# Remove the worktree and delete the branch
wt remove "<branch>" -D
```

The `-D` flag force-deletes the local branch even if it has unmerged changes.

#### Merge a PR and clean up (the `wtm` pattern)

For a branch with an open PR that's ready to merge:

```bash
# From the worktree's directory (or via tmux send-keys)
gh pr merge --admin
wt remove -D
git pull
```

#### Bulk prune merged worktrees

Remove all worktrees whose branches are already merged into the default branch:

```bash
wt step prune --dry-run  # preview first
wt step prune            # remove them
```

### 3. Open Worktree in Browser

Look up the worktree's dev server URL and open it:

```bash
# Get the URL from wt list
url=$(wt list --format=json | jq -r '.[] | select(.branch == "<branch>") | .url')

# Open in the default browser (macOS)
open "$url"
```

The URL pattern for Portal projects is `http://huntress.localhost:<hash_port>`. The port is deterministic per branch name.

### 4. Spawn Parallel AI Agent in a Worktree

Use the `wtc --tmux` command to create a worktree with a dedicated tmux window and launch an independent claude session in it. This lets you delegate a task to a parallel agent while continuing your own work.

**IMPORTANT — `wtc --tmux` is the ONLY way to spawn agents:**

- **NEVER** run `wt switch` to create agent worktrees — it contaminates your current shell
- **NEVER** manually run `tmux new-window` or `tmux send-keys` — `wtc` handles all tmux operations
- **NEVER** try to piece together worktree creation + tmux + claude yourself — `wtc --tmux` does it all in one atomic operation
- **ALWAYS** verify you are in build mode and on the root worktree before calling `wtc --tmux`

#### Writing the prompt

**Always use `-f` (file) for prompts longer than a single sentence.** Write the prompt to a temp file first, then pass it via `-f`. This keeps long prompts safe from shell quoting issues and is easier to review before spawning.

```bash
# 1. Write prompt to a temp file (use branch name for clarity)
cat > /tmp/<branch>-prompt.txt <<'EOF'
Your detailed task description here.
Any "quotes", $variables, `backticks`, and special chars are safe.
EOF

# 2. Spawn with -f
wtc --tmux --name <window-name> <branch> -f /tmp/<branch>-prompt.txt
```

For very short prompts (one sentence), a positional argument is fine:

```bash
wtc --tmux --name auth fix-auth-bug "Fix the auth bug in the login controller"
```

#### Prompt sources

`wtc` accepts prompts from three sources (in priority order):

1. **Positional argument** (short prompts only): `wtc --tmux <branch> "Fix the auth bug"`
2. **File** (`-f`) **(preferred for anything detailed)**: `wtc --tmux <branch> -f /path/to/prompt.txt`
3. **Stdin / heredoc** (avoid — can crash on long prompts due to shell quoting)

#### Options

- `--tmux` — spawn in a detached tmux window (required for parallel agents)
- `--plan` — start claude in plan permission mode (uses `--permission-mode plan` instead of full `--dangerously-skip-permissions`)
- `--name <win>` — custom tmux window name. **Always provide this** when spawning multiple agents — the default (last segment of branch name) causes collisions for branches with shared suffixes
- `-f <file>` — read prompt from a file **(preferred for detailed prompts)**

#### Examples

```bash
# Short prompt — positional argument is fine
wtc --tmux --name auth fix-auth-bug "Fix the auth bug in the login controller"

# Detailed prompt — write to file first, then use -f
cat > /tmp/esql-sort-prompt.txt <<'EOF'
Implement the SORT command for the ES|QL parser.
Only support SORT on aggregation (STATS) queries.

Key files:
- lib/esql/parser.rb
- lib/esql/ast.rb
EOF
wtc --tmux --name sort sc-new-story-esql-sort-command -f /tmp/esql-sort-prompt.txt
```

> **Note:** Use `wtc --plan` to start the agent in plan permission mode. This uses `--permission-mode plan` so the agent can read and explore but must ask before making changes.

After spawning, `wtc` prints the tmux window name and how to connect:

```
Spawned in tmux window 'auth' on branch 'feature-branch'
Connect: tmux select-window -t ":auth"
```

The agent runs independently. You do not need to wait for it to finish.

#### Spawning multiple parallel agents

Call `wtc --tmux` once per agent. Each call is independent and does not affect your current shell. **Always use `-f` and `--name`** when spawning multiple agents:

```bash
# Write each prompt to its own temp file
cat > /tmp/sort-prompt.txt <<'EOF'
Implement SORT command for the ES|QL parser...
EOF

cat > /tmp/bypass-prompt.txt <<'EOF'
Detect raw ES|QL in AI search and bypass the LLM...
EOF

cat > /tmp/timerange-prompt.txt <<'EOF'
Add TIME_RANGE extraction to NaturalLanguageQuery...
EOF

# Spawn each agent with a unique --name and -f
wtc --tmux --name sort sc-new-story-esql-sort-command -f /tmp/sort-prompt.txt
wtc --tmux --name bypass sc-new-story-ai-search-esql-bypass -f /tmp/bypass-prompt.txt
wtc --tmux --name timerange sc-new-story-nlq-time-range -f /tmp/timerange-prompt.txt
```

## Querying Worktree Status

Use `wt list --format=json` to get structured data about all worktrees. Each entry includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `branch` | Branch name |
| `path` | Absolute filesystem path |
| `url` | Dev server URL (from project `[list]` config) |
| `url_active` | Whether the dev server is responding |
| `is_current` | Whether this is the current worktree |
| `is_main` | Whether this is the main/primary worktree |
| `working_tree.staged` | Has staged changes |
| `working_tree.modified` | Has unstaged modifications |
| `working_tree.untracked` | Has untracked files |
| `main_state` | Relationship to main: `is_main`, `ahead`, `behind`, `diverged` |
| `remote.ahead` / `remote.behind` | Commits ahead/behind remote tracking branch |

## Troubleshooting

### Window name collision (second agent errors out)

Branch names with shared suffixes (e.g., `fix-foo-errors` and `fix-bar-errors`) both default to window name `errors`. `wtc` will now error if the window already exists. Always pass `--name` explicitly with a unique name per agent.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to create a worktree, branch environment, or parallel workspace
- User asks to spin up or launch a parallel agent/task
- User asks to clean up, remove, or prune worktrees
- User asks to open a worktree's dev server in the browser
- User asks to list or check the status of active worktrees
- User asks about worktree ports or URLs
